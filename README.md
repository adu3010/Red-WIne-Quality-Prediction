# Red-WIne-Quality-Prediction
Getting into the 🍷 spirits 😉 with my latest machine learning project predicting red wine quality! 🍇 I compared three different regression models - Linear Regression 📏, Decision Tree 🌳, and Random Forest 🌲 to see which performed best at predicting wine quality on a dataset of red wines 🍷.
